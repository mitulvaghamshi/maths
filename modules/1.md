# 1.1 NON POSITIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM

- Digits in a non-positional number system have a same value regardless of their
  position.
- An example is Roman Numeral System.
- The digits used in this number system and their values are:

| DECIMAL | $1$ | $5$ | $10$ | $50$ | $100$ | $500$ | $1000$ |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :----: |
|  ROMAN  | $I$ | $V$ | $X$  | $L$  |  $C$  |  $D$  |  $M$   |

- The following rules are satisfied when writing and reading roman numerals:

1. Two or three same digits (from $I, X, C, M$) in a row represent the sum of
   their individual value.
- $II = 2$
- $CCC=300$
- $MMM=3000$

2. Two digits where the smaller one is in front of the bigger represent their
   difference.
- $IV = 4$
- $IX = 9$
- $XL=40$

3. Two digits where the smaller one is after the bigger represent their sum.
- $VI = 6$
- $XI = 11$
- $LV=55$

4. There can only be put one smaller digit (from $I, X, C$) in front of a
   bigger; the smaller letter can be one fifth $(1/5)$ or one tenth $(1/10)$ of
   the larger one;
- $99$ cannot be $IC$ as $I$ is one hundredth part of $C$.
- Instead, $99 = XCIX$.

5. There can be $1, 2$ or $3$ same digits that are smaller written after a
   bigger digit, in which case their value will be added together and added
   again to the bigger digit.
- There can only be $CM=900$, but there can be $MCCC=1300$.

6. There cannot be more than one digit written together from the second row of
   digits above $(V, L, D)$.
- Within the roman numerals there is no representation of $0 (zero)$.
- It will be very difficult to perform arithmetic operations within this system,
  as well as writing larger numbers.

## Example 1: Write the following numbers with roman numerals:

| DECIMAL | ROMAN        |
| ------- | :----------- |
| $27$    | $XXVII$      |
| $54$    | $LIV$        |
| $87$    | $LXXXVII$    |
| $369$   | $CCCLXIX$    |
| $1639$  | $MDCXXXIX$   |
| $2409$  | $MMCDIX$     |
| $3744$  | $MMMDCCXLIV$ |
| $4839$  | $\text{n/a}$ |

## Example 2: Write the following numerals in decimal form:

| ROMAL       | DECIMAL |
| ----------- | :------ |
| $XLII$      | $42$    |
| $MI$        | $1001$  |
| $CCXVIII$   | $218$   |
| $DIV$       | $504$   |
| $CMXXVI$    | $926$   |
| $MMCDXLIV$  | $2444$  |
| $MMMCDVIII$ | $3408$  |
| $MDCLXVI$   | $1666$  |
