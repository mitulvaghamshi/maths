# 1.1 NON POSITIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM

- Digits in a non-positional number system have a same value regardless of their
  position.
- An example is Roman Numeral System.
- The digits used in this number system and their values are:
  - $ I(1) $
  - $ X(10) $
  - $ C(100) $
  - $ M(1000) $
  - $ V(5) $
  - $ L(50) $
  - $ D(500) $

- The following rules are satisfied when writing and reading roman numerals:

1. Two or three same digits (from $ I, X, C, M $) in a row represent the sum of
   their individual value.
   - For example: $ II = 2; CCC=300; MMM=3000; $
2. Two digits where the smaller one is in front of the bigger represent their
   difference.
   - For example: $ IV = 4; IX = 9; XL=40' $
3. Two digits where the smaller one is after the bigger represent their sum.
   - For example: $ VI = 6; XI = 11; LV=55; $
4. There can only be put one smaller digit (from $ I, X, C $) in front of a
   bigger;
   - The smaller letter can be one fifth (1/5) or one tenth (1/10) of the larger
     one;
   - For example, $ 99 $ cannot be $ IC $ as $ I $ is one hundredth part of $ C
     $. Instead, $ 99 = XCIX $.
5. There can be $ 1 , 2 $ or $ 3 $ same digits that are smaller written after a
   bigger digit, in which case their value will be added together and added
   again to the bigger digit.
   - For example: there can only be $ CM=900 $, but there can be $ MCCC=1300 $.
6. There cannot be more than one digit written together from the second row of
   digits above ($ V $, $ L $, $ D $).

- Within the roman numerals there is no representation of $ 0 $ (zero).
- It will be very difficult to perform arithmetic operations within this system,
  as well as writing larger numbers.

## Example 1: Write the following numbers with roman numerals:

1. $ 27 = XXVII $
2. $ 54 = LIV $
3. $ 87 = LXXXVII $
4. $ 369 = CCCLXIX $
5. $ 1639 = MDCXXXIX $
6. $ 2409 = MMCDIX $
7. $ 3744 = MMMDCCXLIV $
8. $ 4839 = n/a $

## Example 2: Write the following numerals in decimal form:

1. $ XLII = 42 $
2. $ MI = 1001 $
3. $ CCXVIII = 218 $
4. $ DIV = 504 $
5. $ CMXXVI = 926 $
6. $ MMCDXLIV = 2444 $
7. $ MMMCDVIII = 3408 $
8. $ MDCLXVI = 1666 $
